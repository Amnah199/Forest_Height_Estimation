# WWU: Data Analytics II Case Study
### Context
The Federal Ministry for the Environment is seeking to find the height of every forest in Germany. However only sparse labels are available. 
### Objective
The task of this case study is to determine and approximate the height over forests. This regression is realized with a Machine Learning Regressor and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### Data
- Trainind set for training the model
- Public test set for testing the model
- Hidden test set for evaluating the model to determine grades
